# Overview

I wanted to learn more about 3D rendering. To do this, I created a 3D render
that renders pixels in 3D space based on thier colors. It converts the R, G, B
values into X, Y, Z coordinates. It also shows some clusters of pixels with 
"spheres" (they aren't really spheres) around the area. The user can rotate the
rendered pixels around the center with the arrow keys.

A link to a YouTube demonstration. It is a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. (not yet added)

# Development Environment

I used visual studio community on a windows computer to develop this code.

I used C++ and the GLUT libraries.
